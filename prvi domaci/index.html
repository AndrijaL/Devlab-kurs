    (Yo, left, yo, left) 'Cause sometimes you just feel tired
    (Yo, left, right, left) Feel weak, and when you feel weak
    (Yo, left, yo, left) You feel like you wanna just give up
    (Yo, left, right, left) But you gotta search within you
    (Yo, left, yo, left) Try to find that inner strength and just pull that shit out of you
    (Yo, left, right, left) And get that motivation to not give up
    (Yo, left, yo, left) And not be a quitter
    (Yo, left, right, left) No matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse
</p>

    'Til I collapse I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
    'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em
    'Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pennin' 'em
    And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
    Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin' 'em?
    Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
    Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
    Amoxicillin's just not real enough
    The criminal, cop-killin', hip-hop villain
    A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
    You're comin' with me, feel it or not
    You're gonna fear it like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us
    You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
    Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?
    Fa' shizzle, my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up
    You bizzles forgot, Slizzle does not give a fuck
